MEMORY
=====

Simple memory game written in React to run in the browser or on a mobile device.

It's responsive, so give that a try!


SETUP
=====

First, make sure you're running a recent version of Node and NPM, either by setting your version via NVM or installing/upgrading your current version to the latest.

Next, from within this directory, run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Finally, run `npm start` to start the app.  You can access it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.


DESIGN NOTES
============

Everything here is hand written.

Javascript can be found in the `src/static/js` directory. It is written in React and ES6.

Styles can be found in the `src/static/js` directory. They are written in SASS and imported (via webpack) into the javascript modules.

Images are copyrighted materials lifted from searching Google Images, and as such are not valid for repulishing in any manner.

Due to the relative simplicity of this app and the very small amount of logic involved, I chose not to use Redux. I also felt that setting up for unit tests (while a good thing to demonstrate in a code challenge) would have significantly over-complicated the app design, again, due to the extremenly simple nature of the logic being used.
